FlatFileDB
==========

PHP Flat File DB library with cache for CMS

## Why?

On my VPS i uses Wordpress that is a fatty slow MySQL app.

Faster websites performs better also in SEO ranking.

## Technology

Don't reinvent the wheel.

Uses "dba" with "qdbm" format.

## Features

DBA is a module so its faster then any self-made implementation.

Table Locking.

Library has a little "cache" system on top of DBA.

Can store anything: strings, arrays, objects.

## TODO

Database Locking.

Disable Locking.
