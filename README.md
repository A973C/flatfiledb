PHP Flat File DB library with cache for CMS

## Why?

On my VPS i uses Wordpress that is a fatty slow MySQL app.

Faster websites performs better also in SEO ranking.

## Technology

* Don't reinvent the wheel.

* Uses "dba" with "qdbm" format.

## Features

* DBA is a module so its faster then any self-made implementation.

* Table Locking.

* Library has a little "cache" system on top of DBA.

* Can store anything: strings, arrays, objects.

## Road Map

* Database Locking.

* Disable Locking.

## Example

```
